# Note manager

I made an application where you can write, delete and save your notes!

## Usage

If you click the `+` button, you'll create a **new `template` note**, so you can change it's title and content, just like the third one in in the example above. <br> <br>

if you wanna delete some note or just don't want it anymore, you can simply delete it. <br> <br>

But if you want to delete `ALL` your notes, you have a basic clear button where you can click; and if you do you have to confirm you are sure you want to delete all your notes, just like this:

You know, <br>
`YES` **delete all** <br>
`NO` **just go back to the main view**

## Future features:

* A Markdown supporter
* Local storage (*i'm working on it*)
* Maybe more animations, for the UX.

### Made with:

* HTML
* SCSS
* Jquery
